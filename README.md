# BAB Developer Objective Task - Spring 2022

## Introduction

Welcome to the Blockchain at Berkeley objective task for developers. This task is due **Thursday Feb 3rd by 11:59pm**

## The Tasks

You are given 2 tasks. Please complete them both receive full points. Make sure you are able to explain your thought process behind your solution. Lastly, this is not a collaborative task, so please do not work with others or plagiarize any code.

For the coding questions, write solutions in Python 3 such that you pass the provided test cases and any test cases you can come up on your own. Remember, the code you write should provide the correct solution for all cases, not just the provided examples.

**WARNING:** You should be writing custom test cases or evaluating them within the interpreter because there are a lot of cases we will be testing for.

## Words of Encouragement

This is for us to gauge your level of comfort with various coding concepts, as well as your willingness to go out of your way to learn new things. We promise that the rest is much more relaxed. If you are an underclassman and you don't understand some of these questions - that's fine, but you should keep trying and come to office hours if you need help!

Upperclassmen, you've probably seen more difficult questions, so we hope that you can answer these questions reasonably well.

Good luck and email Joe (joe.mo@berkeley.edu) or Sishir (sis1001@berkeley.edu) if you have questions.

## Submission Instructions

_DO NOT FORK THIS REPO._ SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PUBLIC WILL BE DISQUALIFED. We ask that you do not share any solutions and work alone.

Instead, zip up the contents of the root of this repo and submit those using a google form: https://forms.gle/U8NEthf9vwWxf34t8. Only submit completed tasks in the zip.

Do not change or rename the folder structure. We will be running autograders on these and if the format fails then we will not accept them as valid solutions.

_The contents of the zip file should be the folders in this repo._
